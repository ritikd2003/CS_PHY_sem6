# CS_PHY_sem6
Here, I have presented some "Python Codes" that is mainly used in solving "Physics Problems". 
(I have used this during my BSMS sem 06)
1. Root finding --> { Bisection method, newton rapson method ( tangent method) and secant method }
2. Numerical diff & integral --> { Forward difference, Backward difference, Central difference, Five-point approximation, linear curve fitting, Trapezoidal method, simson 1/3 method, simpson 3/8 method, bode's method }
3. solving ODEs --> {Euler, Mid point, RK4, verlet, velocity verlet, leapfrog. }
4.
